CO2 Forecasting utilizing the ARIMA and SARIMAX ML Models

# Time Series CO2 Forecasting

Problem Statement: CO2 emissions are one of the biggest causes of global warming, and their consequences are getting serious over time. The objectives of this study is to determine, using an ARIMA model over the time series of the CO2 emission from electricity generation.
Input and Output Variables: Inputs: Source, Date (MM/YYYY), Emissions (Million Metric Tons). Targets: Forecasted Emissions (Million Metric Tons)
Machine Learning Algorithm(s): ARIMA and SARIMA models are designed for analyzing and forecasting univariate time series data. ARIMA was used when CO₂ emissions exhibit a trend but no seasonality. SARIMA was used when emissions display seasonal patterns (e.g., winter spikes). These models are used as they are reliable, interpretable, and effective for short-to-medium-term forecasting, making them ideal for time series data like CO₂ emissions. ARIMA and SARIMA models are widely used for time series forecasting due to their robustness and simplicity.
